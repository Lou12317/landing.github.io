    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <p> My life has always been strongly influenced by athleticism.<sup>1</sup> Growing up on the streets, 
        I was surrounded by my surroundings.<sup>2</sup> Playing traditional games like luksong baka, tumbang preso, 
        and habul-habulan while growing up in Antipolo City helped me develop my agility, strategy, and teamwork.<sup>3</sup> 
        These games, which have a strong cultural foundation in the Philippines, developed a love of sports 
        and healthy competition.<sup>4</sup> In addition to this, basketball became a passion of mine, improving my hand-eye 
        coordination and enhancing my physical skills.<sup>5</sup> I developed a passion for puzzles like dama, sci-dama, chess, 
        and Rubik's Cube at the same time.<sup>6</sup> In grade 4, my focus was Sci-dama, a complicated checkers variant,
        leading to a 2nd place finish in our school's championship.<sup>7</sup> This accomplishment strengthened 
        my respect for good planning and strategic thinking.<sup>8</sup> I am a more well-rounded person as a result of 
        these experiences, both mental and physical.<sup>9</sup> While playing mind games sharpened my analytical and
        problem-solving skills, my athletic experience provided discipline and a spirit of competition.<sup>10</sup> 
        I can tackle problems creatively and resolutely because of my combination of mental and physical agility.<sup>11</sup> 
        I have a strong connection for sports and physical challenges, and I feel at ease doing any 
        kind of exercises.<sup>12</sup> My early experiences left an enormous appreciation for the importance of 
        physical activity and its favorable impact on both bodily and mental well-being.<sup>13</sup> I am always excited to try new academic and athletic pursuits because of this desire.<sup>14</sup> 
        I think that playing basketball, mind games, and traditional Filipino games has helped me develop as an athlete and strategist while also teaching me important life lessons like perseverance, teamwork, 
        and the need to keep an active and positive attitude.<sup>15</sup> I am anxious to use 
        my athleticism and skills in upcoming challenges since I am confident in my ability.<sup>16</sup>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>My hobbies have changed a lot over time, but right now, I mostly spend my time sleeping and working on school activities.<sup>1</sup> 
        Before, I used to have so many hobbies, like playing basketball, which was a huge part of my life.<sup>2</sup> 
        My friends and I would go to different courts just to challenge other players, and sometimes,
        we even made bets either for money or just for a bottle of water but no matter the stakes, the games were always intense.<sup>3</sup> 
        Another hobby I really enjoyed was playing billiards, especially during the pandemic.<sup>4</sup> 
        My friends and I would play until late at night, sometimes so late that we just ended up sleeping by the pool.<sup>5</sup> 
        I also love riding motorcycles with my friends, and we often take trips to nature spots in places like Angono,
        Taytay, Binangonan, and Paenaan.<sup>6</sup> One of my longest rides was from Antipolo to Bulacan and then to Infanta,
        Quezon, where there’s a beautiful beach that made the long trip totally worth it.<sup>7</sup> Sometimes, 
        we just ride along Marilaque to experience the famous Devil’s Corner, which is both thrilling and a little scary.<sup>8</sup> 
        I also used to go to the gym regularly, but lately, I’ve been too busy with school, so I only go when 
        I have the time.<sup>9</sup> Even though I miss my old hobbies, I understand that priorities change, and right now,
        my focus is on my studies.<sup>10</sup> Still, I hope to get back into playing basketball and riding more often
        when I have the chance.<sup>11</sup> Looking back, I realize how much fun I had doing all these activities, 
        especially with my friends.<sup>12</sup> Whether it was the competitive rush of basketball, the strategic plays in 
        billiards, or the freedom of riding on open roads, each hobby gave me a different kind of excitement.<sup>13</sup> 
        I also miss the bonding moments, like the late night talks after a long ride or the laughter after a 
        heated billiards match.<sup>14</sup> These hobbies weren’t just pastimes—they were moments that made my days more
        exciting and memorable.<sup>15</sup> Even though I don’t get to do them as often now, I know they’ll always be a part
        of who I am.<sup>16</sup> Maybe once my schedule frees up, I can go back to doing the things I love.<sup>17</sup> 
        Until then, I’ll just keep pushing through with my studies and make time for my hobbies whenever I can.<sup>18</sup> 
        Life keeps moving, and so do my interests, but I know that the things I once loved will always find 
        their way back to me.<sup>19</sup></p>
