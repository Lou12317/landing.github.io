    <h2>Childhood Years</h2>
    <p> Hi, my name is John Louie R. Canco<sup>1</sup>. I'm from Antipolo City, and I'm 19 years old<sup>2</sup>.
        My birthday is May 17<sup>3</sup><sup><sup>th</sup></sup>, Taurus, and my year is 2005, the year of the rooster<sup>4</sup>.
        I have 2 siblings; I'm the middle one, both brothers<sup>5</sup>. The older one is now graduated,
        and his course is marine; on the other hand, the youngest is just entering college, and my mom is a teacher
        in a public school located in Antipolo, and my father is a chef on a ship<sup>6</sup>. My hobbies are
        riding motorcycles, watching movies or series, playing basketball, playing online games, and sleeping<sup>7</sup>.
        The first thing that I'm going to talk about is my childhood<sup>8</sup>. During my kinder time, I think
        my school is a private school<sup>9</sup>. I'm not sure because it's a long time ago<sup>10</sup>.
        My lolo is the one that bathed and sundo me because at that time my mother and father were working,
        so most of the time my lolo is the one that always spent time with me<sup>11</sup>. My grandmother,
        at that time, passed away; that's why my lolo is the one I have most of my memory of<sup>12</sup>.
        Back to the topic, during the elementary days, I switched schools<sup>13</sup>.
        That school is Spring of Joy Christian School<sup>14</sup>. That is close to my house,
        and both of my brothers are also attending there<sup>15</sup>.
        I have a fun time in that school because I have made so many friends, and during that time I'm active in
        activities<sup>16</sup>. Like when I was in grade 3, we joined a competition in dancing culture, and we battled so
        many schools<sup>17</sup>. Unfortunately, we lost<sup>18</sup>. During grade 4, I joined a SCI chant competition
        in our school, and I got 2<sup>19</sup><sup><sup>nd</sup></sup> place, and during that time my classmate and I
        also joined a retreat in Zambales<sup>20</sup>. We stayed a week there<sup>21</sup>.
        I think we preached and did all kinds of fun activities<sup>22</sup>.
        Activities like those helped me develop a sense of teamwork and a deeper understanding of my peers<sup>23</sup>.
        Looking back, those experiences not only shaped my skills but also created lasting memories that
        I cherish to this day<sup>24</sup>.</p>

<section id="teenage">
    <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
    <p>When I was in grade 5, I transferred to another school that is also close to my house<sup>1</sup>. The school's name is
        Precious Heritage Christian School<sup>2</sup>. Compared to my last school, most of my friends and classmates in this school
        are still close to me, and I have also made so many friends there<sup>3</sup>. During that time, I was active in basketball,
        and my friends and I personally joined some competitions at different places, and we also represented the
        barangay at that time in basketball, and I also joined some programs about basketball so I can improve more<sup>4</sup>.
        Unfortunately, when I was in grade 7, I transferred again to another school, so I did not continue to pursue
        basketball<sup>5</sup>. The name of the new school is San Antonio de Padua Arvegui, Sr. Memorial (DAYSM)<sup>6</sup>.
        I also met so many people there<sup>7</sup>. I stayed in that school for 4 years, so basically, I stayed there in my
        whole high school<sup>8</sup>. During that time, I had no interest in joining activities in school, as I was focused on my
        studies<sup>9</sup>. Most of the things that I did there were just attend classes, but I also joined some activities,
        like intramurals<sup>10</sup>. I like that event there because it allows us to know to play and test the foundation day event
        of the school is also fun<sup>11</sup>. There are so many events, like song competitions and band showings, and there are
        so many booths for activities and foods<sup>12</sup>.</p>

<section id="college">
    <h2>College Years</h2>
    <p> During the pandemic, I basically watched some movies and series and slept a lot while we used online classes<sup>1</sup>.
        That was also the time of my moving up<sup>2</sup>. After my moving up, I transferred to another school,
        FEU Cainta<sup>3</sup>. It is a branch of FEU<sup>4</sup>. I attended that for 2 years in my senior year,
        but all my classes were online<sup>5</sup>. However, we attended the prom night of the school, and I graduated
        there<sup>6</sup>. I was going to apply to the school of FEU<sup>7</sup>. I got invited by a friend, so I only
        applied to FEU<sup>8</sup>. The experience I got in the school so far is good<sup>9</sup>. I have come to meet
        some of the professors are good and fun to teach<sup>10</sup>. The co-curricular studies of the school are good,
        and I also created a lot in the first year, and I'm expecting to learn more in this upcoming subject in the
        2<sup>11</sup><sup><sup>nd</sup></sup> semester of the 2<sup>12</sup><sup><sup>nd</sup></sup> year<sup>13</sup>.
        This is my biography<sup>14</sup>.
        Thank you for taking the time to read my journey so far<sup>15</sup>. With each passing year,
        I hope to gain not only knowledge but also meaningful experiences that will help my future<sup>16</sup>. </p>
